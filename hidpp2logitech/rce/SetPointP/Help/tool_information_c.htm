<h3><img src="qm.gif" width="22" height="22" alt="" align="absmiddle"> PS/2 Support</h3>

<p>If you have a device that is connected to your computer using the PS/2 port, you need to install the SetPoint&#x2122; PS/2 driver if you want to customize its button or key assignments. After installing the driver, you will need to reboot your computer to enable support.</p>

<p>If the button is grayed out, it means that a PS/2 driver from Logitech or a third party has already been installed.</p>
