<h3><img src="qm.gif" width="22" height="22" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Swap F&nbsp;key with FN&nbsp;key functions</h3>

<p>Your keyboard F&nbsp;keys are located on the top row of your keyboard. They have two function modes:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><b>Standard F&nbsp;key mode</b>. Pressing one of the F&nbsp;keys alone activates pre-determined functions in the application that you are currently using. The function of each F&nbsp;key depends on which application is active.</p></li>

<li><p><b>Enhanced F&nbsp;key mode</b>. Pressing and holding the <b>FN</b> key and pressing one of the F&nbsp;keys carries out the enhanced feature of that key, usually printed on the F&nbsp;key.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>However, checking the <b>Swap F&nbsp;key with FN&nbsp;key functions</b> box toggles the use of the <b>FN</b> key. So with box checked, to activate enhanced functions press the F&nbsp;key alone, and to access standard F&nbsp;key features press <b>FN</b> + the selected F&nbsp;key.</p>
