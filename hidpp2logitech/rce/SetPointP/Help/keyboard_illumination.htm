<h3><img src="qm.gif" width="22" height="22" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Keyboard Illumination settings</h3>

<p>The SetPoint software lets you adjust and optimize the illumination feature of your keyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Activate illumination with hand detection</b>: When you select this option, the keyboard will automatically detect the movement of your hands and turn off illumination when you draw your hands away from the keyboard. When you place your hands back on to the keyboard to type, hand detection will automatically re-activate keyboard illumination. This is the recommended default setting.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Activate illumination only when I start typing</b>: Selecting this option allows you to choose how long the keyboard will maintain illumination after you have stopped typing. Simply move the slider to the desired laps of time. For example, if you choose one minute, illumination will turn off one minute after you have stopped typing. Illumination will automatically re-activate when you begin typing again. Keep in mind that the longer your keyboard remains illuminated, the sooner you will need to recharge the battery.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Disable keyboard illumination</b>: When you choose this option, keyboard illumination will be fully disabled.</p></li>
