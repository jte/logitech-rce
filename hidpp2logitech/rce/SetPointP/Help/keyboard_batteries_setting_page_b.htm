<h3><img src="qm.gif" width="22" height="22" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Low Battery Notification</h3>

<p>Low Battery Notifications appear briefly on your screen once every three days for a total of nine days. We suggest that you change the batteries on your device during this period.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can disable this feature in the <b>Tools</b> tab by unchecking the Low Battery Notification check box.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Devices with long battery life (greater than 1 year) may continue to work for a few weeks or longer after the Low Battery Notification is displayed.</p>
