<p>Your device's current battery levels are shown. For some devices, the remaining estimated battery power level for the device is shown, in the most appropriate time unit. The estimated figure is based on your past usage.</p>

<p>If a slider is available you can set a value, such as 10%, when you want to receive a low battery warning message from the SetPoint&#x2122; software. Slide it to a lower percentage setting if you want to receive fewer warnings, or to a higher setting if you want to be given more time in which you can use your device before you need to recharge its batteries.</p>
