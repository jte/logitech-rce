<h3><img src="qm.gif" width="22" height="22" alt="" align="absmiddle"> Scroll panel settings</h3>

<p>You can adjust the scroll settings of your mouse's touch pad to suit the way you want to use it.</p>

<p>Drag the scrolling slider to select your scroll speed. The faster the speed, the less accurate the scrolling.</p>

<p>Drag the acceleration slider to choose your vertical scrolling acceleration - low acceleration for accuracy or high acceleration for increased speed scrolling. Using accelerated scrolling means the scrolling gets faster the longer you scroll.</p>

<p>If you want the scrolling to continue even after you remove your finger from the scroll panel, and then eventually slow down, check the <b>Allow inertia scrolling</b> box. With this box unchecked scrolling stops immediately when you release your finger.</p>
