<p>The SetPoint&#x2122; software lets you set up your F&nbsp;keys to suit the way you work and play. By pressing the <b>FN</b> key and a specific F&nbsp;key at the same time you can carry out various tasks on your computer that would usually be several presses or clicks to get to.</p>

<p>Simply select the F&nbsp;key you want to customize in the <b>2. Select F&nbsp;key</b> section and then choose the task you want to assign to it in the <b>3. Select Task</b> section. </p>

<p>For example, you can select <nobr>'E-Mail'</nobr> from the list in <b>2. Select Hot Key</b> and select a task such as 'Open Web Page' from <b>3. Select Task</b>. Once you apply these settings, pressing the <nobr>E-Mail</nobr> F&nbsp;key will launch the <nobr>e-mail</nobr> web site that you have entered.</p>
